Background-->

AI-driven chatbots have gained significant attention in various sectors for their ability to provide automated, efficient, and accurate responses. In the legal domain, chatbots can simplify complex legal language, offer instant assistance, and reduce the workload on legal professionals. The development of these systems often involves Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and knowledge-based systems, making them capable of understanding user intent and generating meaningful replies.

Existing Systems-->

Several existing AI-based legal assistance systems have been developed and studied:

Legal Bot for Public Services (Doe et al., 2020): This system was designed to provide basic legal information and answer frequently asked questions. It uses a rule-based approach combined with NLP to interpret user queries and offer predefined responses.

AI-Powered Virtual Legal Assistant (Smith & Brown, 2019): This assistant focuses on providing personalized legal advice by analyzing user input and matching it with an extensive legal database. It utilizes machine learning algorithms for improving accuracy over time.

Justice Information Chatbot (Lee et al., 2021): Developed for government websites, this chatbot offers real-time case status updates, legal form assistance, and appointment scheduling. It integrates AI and API services to provide comprehensive support.

Legal Query Processing System (Patel et al., 2018): This research explores how NLP techniques can help in processing legal queries efficiently. The system demonstrated high accuracy in interpreting legal language and generating user-friendly responses.

Interactive Legal Advisory Chatbot (Garcia & Kim, 2022): This chatbot emphasizes interactive engagement and aims to provide a conversational experience while offering legal information and guidance.
