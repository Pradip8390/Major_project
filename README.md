# AI-Based Interactive Chatbot for Department of Justice Website

## Abstract

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has opened new avenues for improving public access to legal information and services. This project proposes the development of an AI-based interactive chatbot for the Department of Justice website, designed to bridge the gap between complex legal information and the general public. The chatbot will utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to provide quick, accurate, and accessible responses to legal queries. By offering features such as legal information retrieval, document assistance, and complaint registration process, the system aims to enhance user experience and engagement. The chatbot will also minimize the time and effort required to access legal resources, ensuring accuracy and 24/7 availability without human intervention. Through the integration of existing AI technologies and a deep understanding of user needs, this project aspires to simplify the interaction between citizens and legal institutions, promoting transparency and efficiency within the justice system.
